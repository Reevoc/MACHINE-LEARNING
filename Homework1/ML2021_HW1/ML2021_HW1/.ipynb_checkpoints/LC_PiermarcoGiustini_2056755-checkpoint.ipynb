    "**ANSWER**:This is what I expected during the use of the Perceptron algorithm. First of all, it is important to understand informally that the Perceptron constructs a sequence of vectors w, where the first w is a vector all equal to zeros. At some iteration, the Perceptron finds an example that is mislabeled that the dot product of w and X is different from the label Y. Then, the Perceptron updates w by adding to it the instance X scaled by the label Y.\n",

    "**ANSWER** As expected, comparing the cases respectively with 10000 iterations and 100 iterations, the perceptron performs better in the case of 10000 iteration. In fact, looking at the difference between the traing error with 100 iteration that scores 0.26 and the traing error with 10000 iteration that scores  0.12, it's possible to see a clear improvement of 0.14. However, while evaluating the true loss on the training data I got better result then the traning error, possibly this is due to the fact that we have found the best w for the test data. More precisely, by performing some tests on the perceptron algorithm, we can notice that if we keep increasing the number of iterations the training error keeps going down untill reach value 0. On the other side if we perform the true loss on the w found for every w_found created, it's possible to observe that the true loss doesn't go down from 0.08.\n",
